     Changelog
====================

Thanks for downloading this package!

Changes from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0 include:

Question:

CUDA code is almost the same as C++ code, but I cann't use c++ packages, such as C++ sinppets, in CUDA C++ files.
https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/how-to-enable-c-sublime-package-in-cuda-files-cu-cuh/19014

The Temporary Solution:
Add several frequently-used c++ snippets.

Changed Snippets:
Remove function note and semicolon(;) of all snippets.

Before:
cudaFree(void* devPtr);
/*Frees memory on the device.*/ 

Now
cudaFree(void* devPtr)

As always, reference can be found here:
